#summary Building pygr and running the tests

(Short notes for now -- CTB)

{{{
python setup.py build
}}}

makes an arch-specific directory in build, e.g. build/lib.linux-i686-2.5, that must then be put in sys.path.

Alternatively,

{{{
python setup.py build_ext -i
}}}

builds the pygr extensions "in place" so that you can 'import pygr' in the top-level working
directory.

To run the tests, 'cd tests && python runtest.py -b'; omit _-b_ to use in-place code instead of the build directory. runtest will fail out if it cannot import pygr from within the working directory, to avoid running the tests on the installed version.
