#summary How to set everything up to be able to run megatests.

= Introduction =

The purpose of this page will be to, as soon as it's complete, provide complete instructions for everyone wishing to run megatests on his/her machine - from obtaining the necessary data to actual running of megatests. Note that right now this is work in progress.

== Downloading and preparing data ==

In order to setup pygr megatest on your machines, first step is to download _seqdb.BlastDB_. You can download all seqdb.BlastDB via _biodb2.bioinformatics.ucla.edu_, see the PygrResourceDownloader page for more details.

These are lists of _seqdb.BlastDBs_ to download from _biodb2.bioinformatics.ucla.edu_:

# for dm2 megatest (annotation database, NLMSA MAF format)
 msaSpeciesList = ['anoGam1', 'apiMel2', 'dm2', 'dp4', 'droAna3', 'droEre2', 'droGri2', 'droMoj3', 'droPer1', 'droSec1', 'droSim1', 'droVir3', 'droWil1', 'droYak2', 'triCas2']

# for hg18 megatest (annotation database, NLMSA MAF format)
 msaSpeciesList = ['anoCar1', 'bosTau3', 'canFam2', 'cavPor2', 'danRer4', 'dasNov1', 'echTel1', 'equCab1', 'eriEur1', 'felCat3', 'fr2', 'galGal3', 'gasAcu1', 'hg18', 'loxAfr1', 'mm8', 'monDom4', 'ornAna1', 'oryCun1', 'oryLat1', 'otoGar1', 'panTro2', 'rheMac2', 'rn4', 'sorAra1', 'tetNig1', 'tupBel1', 'xenTro2']

# for hg18 megatest, pairwise alignment, axtNet format input
 msaSpeciesList = ['canFam2', 'hg18', 'mm8', 'panTro2', 'rn4']


_PYGRDATADOWNLOAD_ should be set to your own directory in which all _seqdb.BlastDBs_ will be saved.

 os.environ['PYGRDATADOWNLOAD'] = '/my/seqdb/path'

At the top of each dm2/hg18 megatest files in tests directory, you can see following lines. You may need to change following lines to _PYGRDATADOWNLOAD_ path. If you want to maintain original *megatest.py* files intact, you may need to create following directory in your megatest machine.

 seqDir = '/result/pygr_megatest/seq_data'

 seqDir = '/result/pygr_megatest/seq_data3'

All the necessary pre-built NLMSA and pre-calculated results are available at http://biodb.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/MEGATEST/

And, there are some sets of pre-build NLMSA. These pre-built NLMSA files should be saved in your machine.

 msaDir = '/result/pygr_megatest/maf_test'  # maf_test.tar in biodb MEGATEST URL.

 msaDir = '/result/pygr_megatest/maf_test3' # maf_test3.tar in biodb MEGATEST URL.

All the test results and NLMSA will be saved subdirectory of _/usr/tmp/deepreds_. You can find _/usr/tmp/deepreds_ path in all of *megatest.py*. You may need to change this directory or create one for megatest.
