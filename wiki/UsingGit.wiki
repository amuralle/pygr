#summary How to best use git for Pygr development.

= Why Git? =

Git is the front-runner of a new generation of "distributed source code management" tools that make it much easier for a dispersed group of developers to collaborate on a complex open source project like the Linux kernel.  The first thing to understand is that git dumps the previously universal assumption of a centralized repository, which developers check out files (from) and check in changes (to).  Instead, with git, *every* developer has the complete repository, storing the complete revision history.  That makes it much easier for each developer to work independently -- s/he doesn't even need a net connection to make commits.  Developers can clone a repository from each other, pull changes from each other, email patches to each other, push changes to a public site etc.  Second, git makes it spectacularly easy to work with branches: at any moment, you can create a new branch off your current code, make experimental changes as a series of commits on that branch -- without in any way affecting your "master" branch or any other branch -- and switch instantly between different branches.  Merging in changes from one branch to another is amazingly easy and powerful in git, so if you decide you like your experimental changes, you can apply them to your "master" branch easily -- typically with just a single command "git merge".  Git has great momentum now, and it has already been a terrific boost to Pygr development.

= Overview of How We're Using Git =
The Pygr project is tiny in comparison with Linux kernel, so we can get away with a pretty simple development model:
  * I own the "master" branch; i.e. all proposed changes pass through me.
  * I make changes in my git repository.
  * I push changes to the public git repository.
  * Anyone else can get their own copy of the repository by using "git clone" from the public repository.
  * Anyone else can create their own branch (in their own git repository), to try out changes that they want to make.  *Don't make changes in the master branch* as this will complicate your ability to pull from the public repository in the future; instead always create a separate branch in which to make your changes.  In doing so, you just commit your changes as usual, but in your branch, not in the "master" branch.
  * If you have finalized changes that you want incorporated into the master branch, send them to me as email patches.  I will then examine them (typically as a temporary branch in my repository), and if I see no problems, will merge them into the master branch.
  * We can create separate branches for a specific release cycle.  E.g. I created a branch v0_7 for bug fixes to version 0.7.  It's trivial to pull bug fixes from the master branch into the v0_7 branch, and vice versa.

= Git Usage Examples =
=== Get a copy of the public repository ===
{{{
git clone git://repo.or.cz/pygr.git
}}}

=== Get the latest changes from the public repository ===
{{{
git checkout master
git pull --rebase
}}}
The first command is only necessary if you were previously working on a different branch than "master".

=== Make an experimental branch and commit changes there ===
{{{
git branch trythis
git checkout trythis
# edit one or more files, test your changes...
git add pygr/sqlgraph.py tests/nosebase.py # whatever files you changed
git add tests/new_test.py # you can also add new files to the repository
git rm tests/old_test.py # and even delete a file (from this branch)
git commit -m 'put a meaningful explanation of your changes here'
# edit some more files...
git add some_more_files.py
git commit -m 'explain your new changes here'
# and so on...
}}}
The basic process for making changes in git is:
  * first, just edit whatever files you want.  You don't have to do anything to "check out" those files!
  * use *git add* on your changed files, to "stage" these changes for committing.
  * use *git commit* to commit all those changes as a single atomic revision.  Note that every commit has a unique ID (long hexadecimal code).  You can generally use this ID (or just its first few digits as long as it's unique) to specify a specific commit in any git command.

=== See a list of branches in your repository ==
{{{
git branch
}}}
The current branch is marked with an asterisk.

=== Switch to a different branch ===
{{{
git checkout master
}}}
Substitute the name of the branch you want for "master".

=== See the current state of any edits you may have made, but not yet committed ===
{{{
git status
}}}

=== See the history and branch structure of the repository with a graphical tool ===
{{{
gitk --all
}}}
Requires X windows and Tk.

=== See repository history as text ===
{{{
git log
}}}

=== Merge new changes from one branch to another ===
{{{
git checkout trythis
git merge master
}}}
This example automatically applies any changes from the master branch that have been made after you created your *trythis* branch.  Git is able to do most merges completely automatically; only if the changes overlap the same lines of code will it ask you to sort out the conflict (it puts diff markers in the relevant file; your job is to edit that file to be the way you want it).

=== Apply a single commit from one branch to another ===
{{{
git checkout trythis
git cherry-pick 37d1f89
}}}
Here we switch to the branch we want to change (in case we're not already on that branch).
Then you specify the commit you want to apply via its SHA1 hash code, or in this case just its first few digits.

=== Generate patch output for emailing me your changes ===
{{{
git format patch master >my_patches.txt
}}}
This outputs patches for all commits in the current branch not in the master branch.

=== Apply someone else's patches to your repository ===
{{{
git checkout -b titus_temp # create & switch to temporary branch
git am <titus_patches.txt # apply the patch file
# inspect changes to see if you like them
# alter as you see fit, make additional commits until you're happy
git checkout master # switch back to master
git merge titus_temp # apply all our approved changes to master
git branch -d titus_temp # don't need this temporary branch any more
}}}
Note that here the net effect was I applied the patches to my master branch.  But of course I could have applied to any branch I wanted.  Note also that I adopt the cautious approach of first testing out all the patches in a temporary branch, rather than directly applying them to master.  This way, if I don't manage to finish this job in one sitting, it is kept separate from my master branch.  Indeed, I could switch back to the master branch and do urgent bug fixes, before switch back to titus_temp to finish my evaluation of the patch(es).

=== Tag a release ===
{{{
git tag v0.7.1
}}}
to tag the current HEAD of the current branch.  You can also tag a specific previous commit:
{{{
git tag v0.7.5 78ac23bb
}}}
