#summary using pygr to develop an Ensembl API

= Introduction =

The Ensembl database system is a central data repository for various eukaryotic genome sequences and their annotated information [http://www.ensembl.org].  Being able to access its numerous large databases efficiently is indispensable to any genome research project. Currently, the Ensembl databases are mostly accessed through a Perl API or a (less developed) Java API. No equivalent Python API is yet available.

The goal of this project is to develop a Python API to access the Ensembl databases, using pygr.  Pygr is a Python database interface framework for bioinformatics that
makes it easy to supply a pythonic interface to genome, annotation and
alignment databases such as Ensembl.  

By developing a Python Ensembl API, we hope to encourage the use of Python for programming in the field of Bioinfomatics.

= How will pygr make the development easier? =

The key advantages of choosing pygr over many other ORMs (object relational mappers, such as SqlAlchemy) are the followings:

*1.* it provides highly pythonic models for bioinformatics data based on
familiar Python constructs such as the mapping protocol (dictionaries) and sequence protocol; 

*2.* these consistent interfaces allow the same client code to work transparently with many different "backend" implementations for how the data is actually stored;

*3.* the client code is insulated from the complexities of back-end database queries; 

*4.* pygr works with a wide variety of backend storage systems that provide tremendous scalability for challenging bioinformatics database problems such as terabyte-size multigenome alignments;

*5.* pygr provides strong support for modeling database schemas, and greatly simplifies the problem of accessing and distributing complex database schemas (it transforms them into an "importable" python namespace).

These core capabilities will allow us to focus on problems that are
truly specific to the Ensembl data, rather than general
infrastructure, while delivering a solution that will be much easier
for bioinformatics researchers to use.

= Implementation Details =

Currently, we are in the process of trying pygr to access the dna and exon tables of the ensembl core database and build bi-directional mappings between the genome and the annotation.  For more information, please refer to the following thread [http://groups.google.com/group/pygr-dev/browse_thread/thread/5d55fd9d071fbf4d?hl=en]. 

Stay tuned for further progress reports from us :)
