#summary How to view the Pygr source code repository.

= Introduction =

We've switched from CVS to git as our source code repository system.  You can access the public git repository for Pygr at http://repo.or.cz/w/pygr.git

Feel free to grab your own copy of the git repository:

`git clone git://repo.or.cz/pygr.git`

To get git, or learn more information about how to use it, see http://git.or.cz/
